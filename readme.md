## setup

- to clone this repo in order to work on the **wiki** section, use
`git@github.com:vcavallo/devwiki.wiki.git` - note the `.wiki` in there.
- install **gollum**: `gem install gollum` (you might need to brew install some
  libraries, like `brew install icu4c` or `apt-get install libicu-dev`)

## working on the wii

- go into the `*.wiki` repo that you cloned previously
- run `gollum` and navigate to `localhost:4567` or whatever it is for you.
- edit pages and whatnot...
